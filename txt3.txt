Autism
	ASD and adults
		Assumptions
			More likely to present as Intellectual Delayed
			More likely to be male
			Lower incidence rates
		Change in diagnostic systems over time
			Kanner: Autistic disturbances of affective contact
				First wave up to 75 years of age
			DMM III 1980
				Infantile autism
					second wave now over 38 years of age
			DSM -IV 1994
				Introduction of Asperger's Disorder
					Third wave over 24
		Epidemiology
			Incidence rate of adults: 9.8 / 10,000 1%
			Male : Female 9:1
			More likely to be single
			Less likely to own real estate
			智力下降的很快
		Assessment
			Challenges
				May not have parents available to provide developmental history
				Normative behavior change over time （type of play)
				More isolation may lead to less social comparison （我从来一个人在一起，正常人的生活怎样我也不知道）
				Lifelong pressure to fit into neurotypical world may lead to more camouflage behavior
				ASD symptoms can be overshadowed by other medical conditions
				may be triggered by setback phenomenon
		Co-occurring Mental Health
		Treatment
		Outcome data
			high rate of cooccurring mental health challenges
			increased cost of social challenges
			higher likelihood of medical conditions
	ASD and women
		ASD and gender ratio
			History
				Kanner 8/11 were males
				Asperger 4/4 cases are males
				Male biased understanding of ASD
			In absence of intellectual impairment, ASD is diagonosed both later and less in females
				4:1
				If not intellectual impairment 9:1
				for low IQ 2:1
				女生小时候不容易被诊断出来
				时间长了以后会慢慢被诊断出来
		Measurement bias
			did not factor in gender differences when norming instruments (男女不分家）
			Women more likely to diagnosed as AD/HD. eating disorders. language delay
		Relationship to language
			No speech - no sexual differences
			Limited speech - lower IQ and adaptive skills for female
			Good speech = similar or better for females
		Diagnostic difference for Women "less and later"
			More servere
			bahavior and cognitive impairment
			underreported by teachers
		Female phenotype
			low self-esteem, internalizing and externalizing behaviors
			eating disorder
				in NT  ~ 1 % in ASD 7.9 %
				in NT 10: 1 in ASD 2.5 : 1
			Better Linguistic abilities and imagination
			Greater awareness of social interaction
			Perceived as being shy
			Tend to imitate and camouflage
			Tend to be mothered in primary school and bullying at secondary school
			Restricted interests in animals， being professional perfectionalism
			Passive demand/ avoidance
			Tend to have eating disorders
			Men VS Women
				Male :  imaginative play, circumscribed interests, unusual preoccupation, hand finger, object usuage, preoccupation with objects, fascination in movement, attention to detail
				Female: range of facial expression, self injury, drawing skill, plus hair salon, rubs, scratches self, washing and cleaning, hoarding, self - care bathroom, dressing, strong attachment to one object.
			Female have
				More communication impairment
				Lower level of restricted interests
				Lower cognitive ability
				Weaker adaptive skills

				High level of lethargy (lack of energy)
				Better observational learning
				stronger internal scripting for relationship
				better use of gesture
		Female Camouflage Effect
			Greater interest in socialization
			Fewer repetitive restricted behaviors
			High level of internalizing and less externalizing
			fake eye contact
			learned phase
			Female protective effect
				Your are not autistic
				Pretending to normal
				Passive to assertive
				Forgoing an identity as a woman with ASD
		Cost associated with later diagnosis
			Age of diagnosis (later for female)
			However, age when parents first express concern (no difference)
			late provision of services
			miss opportunity for early intervention
			disproportionate amount of ASD specialist
		Female Bi-modal distribution
			May be that the lower group is more classically ASD and that higher group is atypical and presents differently to males
